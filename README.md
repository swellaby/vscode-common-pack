VS Code Extension Pack that contains a few common extensions that we use everywhere. We noticed we were adding these three as workspace extension recommendations in every project so we decided to bundle them together in this pack!  

Includes: 

* [EditorConfig][editorconfig-url]
* [GitLens][gitlens-url]
* [Code Spell Checker][cspell-url]
